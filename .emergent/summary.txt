<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested a pixel-perfect clone of the Zomato website, named Yemek Nerede Yenir for the Turkish market. This evolved into building a unique, professional food platform inspired by Zomato.

Recent user requests have focused on adding specific Zomato-like features, creating a separate UI for Dine-in restaurants, implementing advanced filtering, and location-based searching. After completing these web features and performing some SEO enhancements, the user's latest and most urgent request is to build a complete React Native mobile application that mimics Zomato's app functionality. Following a request to deploy, the user then asked for a full system audit to identify any missing features before proceeding. The audit was completed, and the user's final instruction was to address the gaps found in the mobile application.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Zomato-Inspired Functionality:** Implement features observed on Zomato for both web and mobile, including advanced filtering, quick filters, collections, and distinct flows for online ordering vs. dine-in.
2.  **Dine-in Specific UI/UX:** A separate layout and user experience for restaurants that only offer Dine-in.
3.  **Complete Admin Backend:** A comprehensive backend panel to manage all content.
4.  **Location-Based Features:** Implement location-based restaurant searching and clickable feature tags.
5.  **SEO & PWA:** The web application should be optimized for search engines and function as a Progressive Web App.
6.  **React Native Mobile App:** A fully functional mobile application for Android and iOS, mirroring Zomato's app.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish (Türkçe). The next agent MUST respond in Turkish.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. The web application features a unique UI, a comprehensive admin panel (backend complete, frontend partially implemented), user authentication, location-based search with OpenStreetMap, and e-commerce functionalities like cart and profile management. Basic SEO (React Helmet) and PWA configurations have been implemented. A foundational React Native mobile application has been scaffolded in the  directory with basic structure, navigation, and placeholder screens, but it is not yet functional or connected to the backend.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested the completion of the mobile application. The agent started by creating the foundational structure for the React Native app but then was asked to perform a comprehensive feature audit of the entire platform. The agent used the  to conduct this audit, which identified several missing frontend implementations in the admin panel and confirmed the mobile app is only a scaffold. The user's last message directed the agent to complete the missing parts of the mobile application.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N (for the mobile app)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** The mobile app will require manual testing via Expo Go or a testing agent capable of React Native testing once development is complete.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** The  collections feature was not rendering correctly on  due to a CORS/mixed-content issue when the frontend (HTTP) called the preview URL (HTTPS). The agent confirmed it works on the deployed preview URL but did not fix the local development experience. (P2)
-   **Issue 2:** The backend API for restaurants had an ObjectId serialization error that was fixed. However, similar issues might exist in other endpoints that were not tested as thoroughly. (P2)
-   **Issue 3:** The frontend application compiles with  warnings in React hooks, which was noted in the initial handoff but has not been addressed. (P3)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Homepage Collections Not Loading on Localhost**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** Added a trailing slash to the API call in the frontend (). This did not resolve the issue for local development.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Investigate the 307 Temporary Redirect that happens when  calls the backend from .
        2.  Consider configuring FastAPI to not enforce a trailing slash or have  handle redirects differently.
        3.  As a last resort, align local development to use HTTPS or a proxy to avoid mixed-content issues.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To provide a smooth local development experience and prevent confusion.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1:** Complete React Native Mobile Application (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)
    -   **Where to resume:** The basic file structure, navigation (), services, contexts, and placeholder screens (, , etc.) are created in . The next step is to implement the UI for each screen, connect them to the backend services (), manage state with the created contexts, and ensure navigation works as expected.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A functional mobile application that fulfills a core user requirement.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both (Mobile app and the backend APIs it consumes).
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **(P1) Implement Missing Admin Panel Frontend:** The system audit revealed that while backend APIs exist for most features, the admin frontend is incomplete. The UI for managing **Reviews, Notifications, and API Keys** needs to be created in .
    *   **(P2) Live Order Tracking:** Implement a system for users to track their food orders in real-time.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **(P3) Full SSR Migration:** For optimal SEO, migrate the React frontend to Next.js as initially discussed.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The user's primary focus has shifted to the mobile application. Your highest priority (P0) is to continue the development of the React Native app in the  directory, transforming the existing scaffold into a functional application. Use the Zomato mobile app as a reference for UI/UX.

After making significant progress on the mobile app, the next priority (P1) is to address the missing frontend implementations in the Admin Panel, as identified by the recent audit. Specifically, build the UI for managing Reviews, Notifications, and API Keys.
