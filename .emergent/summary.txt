<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested a pixel-perfect clone of the Zomato website, named Yemek Nerede Yenir for the Turkish market with a red and white theme. After a discussion about copyright, the plan pivoted to building a professional, fully-featured food platform *inspired* by Zomato, with a unique design and a complete admin backend.

The most recent user request (message 179) revisits the Zomato comparison. The user wants the agent to analyze Zomato's web and mobile app versions again, identify missing features in the current implementation, and add them. The most critical new requirement is to create a distinct and separate UI/UX for Dine-in only restaurants. After these features are completed, the user wants to proceed with SEO optimization and mobile application development. The user also requested advanced admin features like coupons, campaigns, analytics, and API integrations for external systems, along with location-based searching using a free map service (OpenStreetMap).

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Zomato-Inspired Functionality:** Implement features observed on Zomato, including advanced filtering, quick filters, collections, and distinct flows for online ordering vs. dine-in.
2.  **Unique Professional Design:** Create a modern, professional, and unique UI/UX for the user-facing application (this was partially done, but requires revision based on new feedback).
3.  **Dine-in Specific UI/UX:** A new, explicit requirement to design a different layout and user experience for restaurants that only offer Dine-in (table booking) compared to those offering online delivery.
4.  **Complete Admin Backend:** A comprehensive backend panel to manage all content (restaurants, users, menus, orders, coupons, campaigns, analytics, API keys).
5.  **Location-Based Features:** Implement location-based restaurant searching using OpenStreetMap (NOT Google Maps).
6.  **Technical Goals:** The system must be fast and secure. Future goals include excellent SEO and a mobile application.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish (Türkçe). The next agent MUST respond in Turkish.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. The user-facing frontend has been redesigned with a modern, unique UI for the Home, Restaurants, and Restaurant Detail pages. A complete and fully functional Admin Panel has been built, including both backend APIs and a detailed frontend interface, allowing management of users, restaurants, orders, coupons, campaigns, and more. OpenStreetMap has been integrated for location-based search on the backend and map display on the frontend. User authentication, cart, and profile management are functional.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent completed a major redesign of the user-facing frontend (HomePage, RestaurantsPage, RestaurantDetailPage, Navbar) and successfully tested it. However, the user's latest feedback indicates this redesign is incomplete and needs to be revised to include missing Zomato features, especially a unique view for Dine-in restaurants.
-   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING (The redesign is functionally complete, but the user has requested significant additions and changes before approval).
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y (Frontend testing agent was used and all tests passed for the new design).
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** frontend testing agent (after implementing the new user requirements).
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** The application is missing Zomato-like features, and the user is not satisfied. A specific view for Dine-in restaurants must be created, which should have a different UI/UX from Online Delivery restaurants. The agent needs to re-analyze the Zomato web and mobile examples provided by the user. (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:** Implement Dine-in specific restaurant page and other missing Zomato features.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent created a single, generic (but dynamic) restaurant detail page. This did not meet the user's expectation of a fundamentally different layout for the two restaurant types.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Analyze the user-provided Zomato links for web and mobile to understand the differences between dine-in and delivery pages.
        2.  Plan and design a new UI/UX for the Dine-in restaurant detail page.
        3.  Modify  to conditionally render the correct layout based on restaurant data (e.g., a flag like ).
        4.  Ensure backend model  supports this distinction.
        5.  Implement any other missing features identified from the Zomato analysis.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To meet the user's core requirement and get approval to move on to the next major tasks (SEO, mobile app).
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y (The user has mentioned the need for Zomato feature parity multiple times).
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **(P1) SEO Strategy Implementation:** Per the user's request, after completing the feature additions, the next step is to address the excellent SEO requirement. This will likely involve migrating the React SPA to a Server-Side Rendering (SSR) framework like Next.js.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **(P2) Mobile Application Development:** The user wants an Android and iOS application. This will be a separate development effort, possibly using React Native or as a PWA.
    *   **(P3) Live Order Tracking:** Implement a system for users to track their food orders in real-time.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The user is not satisfied with the recently completed UI redesign. Although the agent successfully built a unique, modern interface and a complete admin panel (fulfilling prior requests), the user has now re-emphasized the need for a closer feature match to Zomato.

**Your immediate and highest priority (P0) is to address the user's latest feedback from message 179:**
1.  **Analyze Zomato:** Carefully study the provided web and mobile links for Zomato.
2.  **Implement Dine-in UI:** Create a distinct UI/UX for Dine-in only restaurants on the restaurant detail page. This is the most critical part of the user's request.
3.  **Add Missing Features:** Implement any other Zomato features you identify as missing from the current application.

Only after the user approves these changes should you proceed with the next planned items: SEO optimization and mobile app development.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Working:** The core application, including the new UI and the comprehensive Admin Panel, is functional and tested. User authentication, location search, and core e-commerce flows are working.
-   **Broken:** The user considers the frontend incomplete. The specific UI for dine-in restaurants is missing. The excellent SEO and mobile app requirements are unaddressed at an architectural level.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **OpenStreetMap:** Used for location-based services.
    -   Backend geocoding via external Nominatim API.
    -   Frontend map display via React Leaflet library.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES (Both backend and frontend testing agents were used extensively and successfully for the Admin Panel and UI Redesign).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** None.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent implemented a single, unified design for the restaurant detail page, overlooking the user's earlier, specific request to differentiate between dine-in and delivery restaurants. The user has now re-iterated this as a top priority.</analysis>
